Thera Bank Case Study
--------------------------------------

This case study is about Thera Bank which has a growing customer base. Majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. 
The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business 
and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success.
The objective is to build the best model which can classify the right customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.
